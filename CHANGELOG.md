# Changelog

All notable changes to the Meaningfy Skillery catalogue are documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and the
catalogue version is the `metadata.version` in
[`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`](.claude-plugin/marketplace.json). The version
of record for a release is the git tag `vX.Y.Z`.

Versions at or below `2.4.0` predate this changelog; see the git history and the
`v2.3.0` tag for earlier detail.

## [2.7.3] - 2026-07-01

### Changed

- **README + CONTRIBUTING made CLI-symmetric and accurate.** The README Installation step is now a
  CLI-neutral intention that links the Claude Code and opencode runbooks as peers; the external-deps
  and "Uninstall & conflicts" sections state the real per-CLI status (7/8 deps work on both CLIs;
  `code-review` is a Claude-only optional runner). `CONTRIBUTING.md` gains the dual-CLI contributor
  path (`make generate-opencode`, CLI-agnostic bodies) and fixes stale/contradictory guidance (the
  `EXPECTED_BUNDLES` claim, the "What's inside" table instruction, the Progressive Disclosure
  example). The `dual-cli/compatibility.md` matrix now classifies every referenced dependency.

## [2.7.2] - 2026-06-30

### Changed

- **Durable spec updated.** The `dual-cli-distribution` capability gains the *Single-home dual-CLI
  authoring rule* requirement (synced from the now-archived `dual-cli-docs-refactor` change): the
  "works on both CLIs" rule has one canonical home (`AGENTS.md`), and install docs form a single
  hierarchy (README → `environment-setup.md` → per-CLI runbooks) with `docs/dual-cli/` as a reference
  annex. No code or behaviour change.

## [2.7.1] - 2026-06-30

### Changed

- **Dual-CLI documentation re-seated.** The README now documents opencode support;
  `docs/environment-setup.md` is the dual-CLI install canon (a "choose your CLI" fork), and
  `docs/dual-cli/` is reframed as the reference annex. The "works on both CLIs" authoring rule is
  consolidated into a single canonical **Dual-CLI authoring rules** section in `AGENTS.md` that the
  other docs link rather than restate. Corrects stale inverted-binding wording and the skill count
  (18 → 20). New `dual-cli-distribution` requirement: *Single-home dual-CLI authoring rule*.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- **Dual-CLI distribution — the catalogue now runs identically on Claude Code and
  opencode from one set of sources.** Skills, agents, command content, and hook
  *intent* are authored once and projected to both CLIs, with verified parity. New
  `dual-cli-distribution` capability spec.
- **opencode tree generator** (`tools/opencode_gen`, `make generate-opencode`).
  Reads the single sources of truth (`skills/`, `agents/`, `marketplace.json`,
  `VERSION`) and emits a deterministic committed `.opencode/` tree — skills
  pass-through, agent frontmatter mapped (model alias → `provider/model-id`,
  tools/`disallowedTools` → opencode tool/permission), four role bundles, and
  `opencode.json` — plus committed parity and gap reports. Anything unmappable is a
  recorded `Gap`, never a silent drop. New `dual-cli-generation` capability spec.
- **Three new gates wired into `make validate`** (via `tools.repo_lint`): **drift**
  (committed tree ≠ regenerated), **parity** (an artifact lacks an equivalent or
  gap on one CLI), and **version-sync** (a tree's version ≠ `VERSION`), plus a
  coverage check that every source artifact is mapped or gap-recorded.
- **Pinned opencode version** in `.opencode-version` (`1.17.11`); the generated
  tree conforms to that version's format.
- **Single-`VERSION` rule** — the root `VERSION` file is now the only version
  source; `marketplace.json` `metadata.version`, `opencode.json`, and the
  `.opencode/` bundle manifest all derive from it and are gate-checked for
  agreement.
- **Hook intent inventory** (`hooks/inventory.yaml` + `README.md` + `bindings.md`):
  single-sourced hook intent classified by mechanism (`git`/`ci`/`agent`) and phase
  (`quality`/`phase-gate`); git/ci bindings are shared across CLIs, agent bindings
  render per CLI.
- **Per-CLI documentation** under `docs/dual-cli/` — Claude and opencode setup
  pages over a shared source→CLI mapping reference, an external-dependency/baseline
  compatibility matrix, per-tool MCP setup templates (no config committed), and the
  skill-body CLI-agnosticism audit.

### Changed

- **Root binding inverted**: `AGENTS.md` is now the canonical, CLI-agnostic
  operating manual (read natively by opencode); `CLAUDE.md` is a thin pointer that
  carries only Claude-specific guidance. The previous symlink between them is
  removed. Maintenance docs note that `.opencode/` is generated and must be
  regenerated with `make generate-opencode` after touching any source.

## [2.6.1] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- **PR review now fans out five subagents in parallel, one per lens.** The
  standalone mode gained an explicit *Dispatch contract* — a single combined
  subagent is called out as a defect — fixing the case where only one subagent ran.
- **The review checklist is now catalogue-complete.** The curated subset of ids is
  replaced by a methodical per-lens procedure scoped to a region of the
  `cosmic-python` standard: each lens traverses **every** `PR-*`/`BP-*`/`AP-*` in
  its region plus the matching SKILL sections, so coverage is complete by
  construction and survives catalogue growth. The `code-reviewer` agent is hardened
  to run exactly one lens and refuse a combined pass.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-06-25

### Added

- **Two-mode, five-lens PR review.** `meaningfy-code-review` now defines two
  review modes — **standalone** (the read-only analysis, run as five single-lens
  subagent passes and aggregated) and **interactive** (a thinking-partner protocol
  in the main thread, entered when the developer discusses the PR) — with an
  always-subagent isolation rule that keeps review reasoning out of the
  implementation context.
- **Five review lenses**, one subagent run each, as MECE views over the existing
  checklist: L1 Security & safety, L2 Spec-correctness & tests, L3 Architecture
  conformance, L4 Principles & clean code, L5 Fit, elegance & refactoring. Lenses
  anchor to existing `cosmic-python` catalogue ids — no new ids minted.
- **Fit & refactoring investigation** (lens L5, recommendations-only): assesses how
  new code and the existing code it touches could be refactored for a crisper fit,
  with `gitnexus` blast radius on each candidate.
- New `pr-review-modes` capability spec synced into `openspec/specs/`.

### Changed

- `code-reviewer` agent scoped to **one lens per subagent run** (lens input;
  default dispatches all five), staying read-only and isolated from implementation
  context.

## [2.5.1] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed

- **Spine lifecycle validator hardened against three mechanical flakes** found by
  driving the spine end-to-end:
  - **Archive link depth** — `openspec archive` copied a delta's relative links
    into `specs/` verbatim, leaving over-deep `../` links. Added
    `normalize_spec_links` (a `--fix` mode + `make fix-spec-links`) that recomputes
    depth from the file's location; `broken_links` remains the safety net.
  - **`EXPECTED_BUNDLES` duplication** — bundle membership is now read from
    `marketplace.json` (single source of truth) instead of a hand-kept copy in the
    validator; only the four role names are pinned. Adding a skill no longer edits
    the validator. Placement invariants kept: known role, single home, every skill
    dir registered.
  - **Un-groomed spec `Purpose`** — `make validate` now fails on a `TBD - created
    by archiving` placeholder.

### Changed

- `spec-stewardship` documents the post-archive `make fix-spec-links` step.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- **`explanatory-writing` skill** (`meaningfy-core`) — the craft that makes
  Diátaxis Explanation-quadrant prose read clearly: controlling metaphor,
  concrete-beside-abstract, self-answered question pivots, an 8-axis voice schema,
  positive-default knobs cross-linked to the existing house voice
  (`company-voice.md`, inherited not forked), and variant-batch validation.
- **Writing reference discipline** — writing knowledge lives only in the
  writing-skill family; `technical-writing`, `executive-communication`, and
  `epic-planning` gain by-reference hooks. No bundle reorg.

### Changed

- Archived the `voice-extension-and-enhancement` and `catalogue-ux-and-docs`
  changes, merging their spec deltas into `openspec/specs/`.
