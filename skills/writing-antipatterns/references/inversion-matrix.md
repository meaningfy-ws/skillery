## A1. Duplication & cardinality

**Smell:** one structure restated by hand across sections, unlabelled as a view — or a set that has
outgrown its natural granularity.

**Fails in** Explanation, Decision — read linearly, the reader cannot tell a new section from a
re-cut of the previous one; a set meant to be MECE (ADRs, priorities, scope exclusions) with too
many members signals conflated decisions.

**Required in** Reference, entered at random, where every entry must stand alone — and the
proposal/SoW pair, where the exclusions list is **one list in two documents** (licensed exception,
`SKILL.md` U1).

**Guard:** is the artefact entered at one point or many? Are repeated views generated from one
source, or hand-maintained? Is this set a decomposition (has a natural size) or a catalogue (does
not)?

**Cue:** list the first column of every table — three or more identical value sets in a
read-through document is the defect. For cardinality: is the count domain-driven (a catalogue) or
convention-driven (a decomposition — see `architecture`'s
per-C4-level typical counts: L1 2–3, L2 3–5, L3 2–4, L4 1–2 per system/container, summing to
roughly 8–14 — a range, not a flat "14+ is too many" threshold).

**Fix:** one master table or generated source; compress a decomposition that has outgrown its
natural size.

## A2. Agentless construction

**Smell:** nominalised verb forms and reflexive passives opening a sentence, deleting the actor
("Publication and controlled distribution of the questionnaire"; Romanian *se confirmă, se
evaluează*). Independently named "zombie nouns" (Helen Sword, popularised in Steven Pinker's *The
Sense of Style*) — the same defect documented well outside this catalogue's own source material.

**Fails in** Decision, How-to, Contract — an obligation must attach to a named party and a date.

**Required in** Reference and architecture models, where the subject is a system, not a person
("the endpoint returns 404 when the identifier is unresolved").

**Guard:** is a human being accountable for this sentence becoming true? If yes, name them.

**Cue:** nominalised forms (*-tion*, *-ment*, Romanian *-are/-ire*) opening a list item; reflexive
passives.

## A3. Abstraction with no example, and persuasion inside a commitment

**Smell:** an abstract claim with no concrete instance beside it; or marketing prose, benefit
framing, rhetorical questions inside a document that will be enforced or audited later — both are
ultimately "material that creates an unintended obligation."

**Fails in** Explanation, Tutorial (an unexampled claim can't be checked against experience; the
example *is* the learning) as abstraction; in Contract, Decision record (persuasion reads as an
unintended promise, argued with adversarially later) as persuasion.

**Required in** Reference (a worked example there gets mistaken for the general rule, so omit it)
and Decision persuasive (a proposal that does not persuade has failed).

**Guard:** is the reader trying to understand (needs the instance), or being held to this later (an
instance can create a false precedent or an unintended promise)? Will this document be argued with
now, or enforced later?

**Cue:** named examples per page — zero across an arguing section is the defect. Scan
Contract/Decision-record text for benefit-framing language; if present, persuasion has bled into a
commitment.

**Fix:** add one real artefact for Explanation. Strip benefit framing out of Contract/Decision
record into the paired Decision document instead —
`proposal-writing` already keeps executive voice in the
proposal and "precise, enumerated, no marketing prose" in the SoW.

## A4. Label headings

**Smell:** headings name a topic, not a conclusion.

**Fails in** Decision, Explanation, where the contents page should carry the argument
("Choosing the route" tells a reader nothing; "We choose one route, on confirmed carriers rather
than diaspora size" does).

**Required in** Reference, How-to, where the reader scans for a noun or a task ("Authentication"
beats "Authentication uses bearer tokens" — the reader is hunting a label, not reading a claim).

**Guard:** will the reader read headings in sequence, or scan them for a match?

**Cue:** does every heading contain a verb and a claim? Nouns-only is the defect in Decision;
verbs-and-claims is the defect in Reference.

## A5. Deferred definitions

**Smell:** a term coined early, defined many pages later.

**Fails in** any linearly-read artefact — every term becomes a loan the reader takes out early and
repays at the end, guessing in between.

**Required in** Reference, where one canonical glossary entry, linked from every use, beats
repeating the definition inline.

**Guard:** define at first use when the document is read through; link at every use when it is
entered at random.

**Cue:** measure the gap between a term's first use and its definition — more than a page, in a
linear document, is the defect.

**Acronyms** are terms too: spell out an acronym at first use, in every genre read through — "FAIR
(Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)", then "FAIR" thereafter.

## A6. Hedging

**Smell:** *relevant, usable, sufficient, realistic, indicative, provisional* recurring on every
page.

**Fails as a register** everywhere (recurrence turns intended honesty into the appearance of
indecision); **fails outright** in Contract and Decision record.

**Required as a per-claim marker** in Explanation of contested material, in Reference documenting
version-dependent behaviour, and in `estimation`'s uncertainty ranges,
where naming a range honestly is the entire job.

**Guard:** hedge the specific claim, never the register. State the epistemic principle once at the
top, then write declaratively beneath it.

**Cue:** count hedging adjectives per hundred words; recurrence of the same three words everywhere,
not frequency, is the tell.

**Distinct from** `SKILL.md` U5 (weasel words): hedging qualifies the *author's own* claim; a
weasel word launders a claim through an unnamed source.

## A7. Direct address ("you")

**Smell:** second person used, or avoided, without regard to genre.

**Required in** Tutorial, How-to (instructing a reader) and Coaching dialogue (built on direct
engagement).

**Welcome in** Explanation ("you" collapses social distance).

**Wrong in** Reference (describes a system, not a person) and Decision ("we" carries organisational
commitment; "you" sounds like advice handed across a desk).

**Guard:** am I instructing a reader, teaching a reader, or committing an organisation?

## A8. Dense tables in place of prose

**Smell:** a table strips connectives, so it states *what* but never *why* or *therefore* — nothing
accumulates as the reader moves down it.

**Fails in** Explanation, Decision.

**Required in** Reference, How-to —
`technical-writing`'s own "prefer tables and lists over long
prose" default, correctly scoped to these two quadrants.

**Guard:** does the reader need the relations between the items, or the items themselves?

**Cue:** does the table have a real second dimension, or is it a list with a label column? Count
tables against paragraphs — twenty-five to a dozen is not a document.

## A9. Answer/goal first

**Smell:** the governing thought, or the goal, arrives late.

**Required in** Decision (the reader has ten seconds) and How-to (the goal is stated before the
steps).

**Fails in** Decision record (context → considered options → outcome → consequences; an ADR that
opens with the outcome has destroyed its only reason to exist) and Tutorial (arriving at the result
is the experience; giving it away up front removes the reason to follow the steps).

**Guard:** is the reader deciding/acting now, or auditing/discovering? Explanation sits with
Decision here, because structure outranks texture —
`explanatory-writing`'s own precedence rule: lead with the
answer, apply slow-burn texture beneath it.

Independently corroborated outside this catalogue's source material: "burying the lede" names the
same failure in journalism and business-writing craft.

## A10. Controlling metaphor / figurative material

**Smell:** no organising image where one is needed, or three competing half-metaphors where none
should compete.

**Required in** Explanation — one controlling metaphor, carried start to finish.

**Welcome in** Tutorial, Decision.

**Harmful in** Reference (a metaphor introduces exactly the ambiguity Reference exists to remove)
and Contract (bloats a recipe, or creates the unintended obligation described in A3).

**Guard:** does the reader need a mental model, or a fact? One metaphor or none — three
half-metaphors read as noise in every genre (the one piece of this entry that holds regardless of
genre).

## A11. Premature structure

**Smell:** producing a framework, canvas, or pyramid before the thinking is settled — named
directly in `semantic-consulting-coach`'s own defection
table: "they called me the expert and asked me to design it, so I should produce it."

**Fails in** Coaching dialogue (structure ends exploration, anchors the user on a shape they have
not tested) and in Decision when the governing thought cannot yet be written
(`executive-communication` requires naming the gap, not papering over it).

**Required in** Decision and Contract, once alignment is confirmed.

**Guard:** has the user explicitly asked for synthesis, and is alignment confirmed? Being asked to
"design" or "build" is not that trigger.

## A12. Options shown, not just the choice

**Smell:** only the chosen option appears; rejected alternatives, and why they lost, are invisible.

**Fails in** Decision persuasive — showing your working wastes the reader's ten seconds. The
exception is the asynchronous approval request (see [`decision.md`](decision.md)): its reader
chooses later and alone, so the options must be on the page.

**Required in** Decision record — an ADR's whole reason to exist, years later, is letting a future
engineer see what was rejected and why. Required, more lightly, in Coaching dialogue, where the
user needs live options in front of them, not a foreclosed one.

**Guard:** is the reader committing now (suppress the alternatives), or reconstructing/still
deciding later (show them)?

**Cue:** does the document name at least one rejected option and why? Zero is the defect in
Decision record; more than the one chosen path competing for the reader's attention is the defect
in Decision.

## A13. Curse of knowledge

**Smell:** the writer cannot reconstruct not already knowing the material, so necessary scaffolding
is skipped and jargon lands unglossed. Named by Steven Pinker (*The Sense of Style*) — not present
in this catalogue's original source drafts, added after independent verification.

**Fails in** Tutorial (must assume zero prior knowledge) and Explanation (must build understanding
from an accessible starting point — ties to
`explanatory-writing`'s coin-and-explain craft move).

**Required/acceptable in** Reference and Contract, where assuming domain fluency *is* the explicit
contract with that reader — that assumption is what makes Reference fast to use. Welcome in a live
Decision, but **harmful** in an asynchronous approval request (see [`decision.md`](decision.md)): a
reader who decides days later does not share the writer's context, so a bare record id or link
leaves them unable to decide.

**Guard:** does this genre's reader arrive already fluent, or is fluency what they are building
right now?

**Cue:** read the opening as someone one level less expert than you. Losing them is the defect in
Tutorial/Explanation; it is expected, and correct, in Reference/Contract.

## A14. Negative framing

**Smell:** a claim stated by what something is not, or by double negation ("not unlike", "no
solution without governance", "never lose track of your data").

**Fails in** Decision — a headline, slogan or governing thought framed negatively makes the reader
negate it to find the claim, and plants the very word it denies. Avoid it in Tutorial, Explanation
and Coaching, where the positive form is clearer.

**Required in** Contract / specification, where a prohibition is stated as a prohibition ("the
service MUST NOT store the token"). Welcome in Reference (stating constraints) and Decision record
(naming what was ruled out). In How-to, keep it for warnings ("do not run this on production").

**Guard:** is this sentence a prohibition or a constraint the reader will be held to? If yes, state
it negatively. If it is a claim meant to persuade or teach, state it in the positive.

**Cue:** count the negations in headings and opening sentences; two in one sentence is double
negation in any genre.

**Fix:** restate in the positive ("keeps every change to your data traceable"), or, in Contract,
make the prohibition explicit and enumerable.
