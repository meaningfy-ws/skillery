# BDD / Gherkin Authoring

## Overview

Translate a specification into precise, business-language Gherkin features that define
**what** the system should do in observable, testable terms — not **how**. This is a
**design-phase** activity: the `.feature` files are a **PLAN artifact** authored alongside the
PLAN so `clarity-gate` can score scenario coverage. **Step definitions and production code are NOT
authored here** — they belong to the implement phase (`superpowers:test-driven-development`).
Scenario *thinking* (what to prove, which edge cases) is elicited in `epic-planning`'s interview.

**Where a use case catalogue exists, it is the source, not the EPIC directly.** When the architecture
defines White/Blue use cases (Cockburn — see the `architecture` skill), Gherkin is the **executable
projection** of those use cases, not an independent second spec. Derive scenarios from a UC's Main
Success Scenario, Alternate Scenarios, and Extensions (mapping table in the `architecture` skill's
`use-cases-cockburn.md`); prefer the Blue refinement, which names concrete error codes and boundaries.
Gherkin **adds data, not behaviour**: concrete `Examples:`, boundary values, and edge-case rows that
the UC states abstractly. It **invents no behaviour absent from a use case** — a scenario with nothing
to trace back to is a catalogue gap; fix the UC first, then project. Where no catalogue exists, fall
back to the EPIC acceptance criteria and test-case/error tables.

## Quick Start

1. Read the source spec/EPIC; confirm it is ready (clarity-gate passed) before writing.
2. Write `.feature` files under `tests/features/` (or the project's path), named
   `<capability>.feature`, one file per coherent business capability.
3. Write in **business language** — no SQL, API paths, or class names; only business concepts.
4. Prefer **`Scenario Outline` + `Examples:`** for data-driven coverage:

```gherkin
Scenario Outline: <description>
  Given <precondition>
  When <action with parameter>
  Then <expected outcome>

  Examples:
    | parameter | expected |
    | value1    | result1  |
    | value2    | result2  |
```

5. Cover edge cases **explicitly**, sourced from the spec's test-case table and error matrix.
6. Fabricate sample/test data only where real examples are insufficient; place it in the
   project's fixtures location.

## Quality checks (before finishing)

- [ ] Every task in the breakdown has feature coverage.
- [ ] **Where a UC catalogue exists:** every UC Main Success Scenario, Alternate Scenario, and
      Extension has ≥1 scenario, and every scenario traces back to a UC id (`UC-W1`, `UC-B1.1`) — no
      untraceable, invented behaviour.
- [ ] Every test-case-spec row and every error-matrix row has a scenario.
- [ ] `Scenario Outline` used wherever multiple data variations apply.
- [ ] No implementation details leak in (no SQL / API paths / class names).
- [ ] Files are syntactically valid Gherkin.

## Boundary & Related Skills

**Owns:** feature files + test data. **Does NOT** write step definitions or production code
(that is the implementer's job, following `cosmic-python` + `superpowers:test-driven-development`),
and does NOT plan (`epic-planning`) or score specs (`clarity-gate`).
**Related:** `architecture` (the White/Blue use case catalogue Gherkin projects from), `epic-planning`,
`clarity-gate`, `spec-stewardship`, `cosmic-python`.
