# Generation, custom templates, and automation

Generation is **deterministic and outside the LLM path**: the LLM authors the *source* (YAML), a fixed
`make`-driven toolchain renders the *targets*. Treat it exactly like other schema-based codegen —
regenerate in CI, fail the build on drift (see [`quality-gates.md`](quality-gates.md)). Never hand-edit a
generated file; a needed change goes to the schema or the template.

## The `make generate-models` bridge

One target regenerates everything from the source; nothing downstream edits generated files by hand. Fail
loudly — write to a temp file and `mv` into place only on success, so a failed run leaves no partial
output.

```makefile
generate-models:                ## Regenerate all model targets from the LinkML source
	gen-pydantic --meta None --template-dir $(TEMPLATES)/ $(SCHEMA) > $(GEN_PY).tmp && mv $(GEN_PY).tmp $(GEN_PY)
	gen-json-schema $(SCHEMA) > $(GEN_JSON)
	gen-owl   $(SCHEMA) > $(GEN_OWL)
	gen-shacl $(SCHEMA) > $(GEN_SHACL)
	ruff check --select F401 --select I --fix $(GEN_PY) && ruff format $(GEN_PY)   # match house style
```

Pin the LinkML version deliberately (it is a codegen dependency, not a runtime one) and note *why* —
generators can change output between minor versions; an unrelated dependency bump must not silently
regenerate different code. Bump, regenerate, diff, then accept.

## Custom generator templates (the highest-leverage customization)

LinkML's Pydantic generator supports `--template-dir` with Jinja overrides. Use it to make every generated
model inherit the project's **own strict base class** instead of LinkML's generic `ConfiguredBaseModel` —
so the whole generated set obeys house conventions, defined once in hand-written code. This turns
"generated code" into "generated code that already obeys our conventions."

Worked example (from `mapping-suite-sdk`) — the class template swaps the base:

```jinja
{# templates/class.py.jinja #}
{% if bases == "ConfiguredBaseModel" %}
class {{ name }}(PydanticModel):        {# the project's strict base #}
{% else %}
class {{ name }}({{ bases }}):
{% endif %}
```

The strict base (hand-written, one place) sets the cross-cutting Pydantic config:

```python
class PydanticModel(BaseModel):
    model_config = ConfigDict(
        extra="forbid", validate_assignment=True, validate_default=True,
        use_enum_values=True, populate_by_name=True,
    )
```

Keep override templates minimal — they only swap the base class and strip LinkML meta noise. The same
technique authors a **custom generator for any language**: subclass LinkML's `Generator` (or walk the
schema with `SchemaView`) so the generator is a pure function of the schema — deterministic, no side
inputs — and add it to `make generate-models` and the freshness check.

## Automation of transformations, including diagrams

Everything is a `make` target, not an ad-hoc command — models, secondary artefacts, and **diagrams**:

```makefile
generate-model-view:            ## Diagrams + inspectable schemas from the LinkML source
	gen-plantuml    $(SCHEMA) > diagrams/$(NAME).puml
	gen-json-schema $(SCHEMA) > schemas/$(NAME).schema.json
```

Generate only what is actually consumed somewhere — do not gold-plate artefacts nobody reads.

## Per-module artefact generation (not unified)

A multi-module project generates **dedicated artefacts per module**, mirroring each schema's path into the
output package — not one merged mega-artefact. The pattern (from `mapping-suite-sdk`): walk the schema
tree and mirror the relative path.

```makefile
generate-models-recursive:
	find $(SCHEMA_PATH) -name '*.yaml' | while read -r f; do \
	  rel=$${f#$(SCHEMA_PATH)/}; out=$(PKG)/$${rel%.yaml}.py; \
	  mkdir -p "$$(dirname "$$out")"; \
	  gen-pydantic --meta None --template-dir $(TEMPLATES)/ "$$f" > "$$out.tmp" && mv "$$out.tmp" "$$out"; \
	done
```

`schema/<domain>/<name>.yaml` → `<pkg>/<domain>/<name>.py`, same relative path and basename — trivial to
automate, trivial for a human to locate. Split schemas by bounded concept, one schema file per aggregate;
don't put unrelated domains in one giant file. **Scaffolding this layout into a repo is `project-setup`'s
job** (conditional on the project using LinkML).

## Enable-on-demand target matrix

First-class (wired and tested): **Pydantic, JSON Schema, OWL, SHACL** — the semantic core. Add the rest
only when a project consumes the target: **TypeScript** (`gen-typescript`), **SQL DDL / SQLAlchemy**
(`gen-sqlddl`/`gen-sqla` — keep the repository around the ORM hand-written, in `adapters/`),
**Markdown/HTML docs** (`gen-doc`), **JSON-LD context** (`gen-jsonld-context`), **Neo4j constraints +
neomodel OGM** (below), and further **custom generators** as a project needs them.

### Neo4j constraints + neomodel OGM

Two custom generators, both subclassing LinkML's `Generator` per the mechanism above. Documented
here because the behavior is LinkML-generator knowledge — but the code itself is **not a skill
asset**: a Skill's home is reusable *knowledge* (`spec/skill-repo-governance.md`), not a maintained,
tested codebase. The generators live as repo tooling at `tools/linkml_neo4j/` (tested by skillery's
own `tests/`, same pattern as `tools/repo_lint`/`tools/bundle_gen`), and `project-setup` is the one
that projects a pinned copy into a consuming repo — this skill cites them, it doesn't own them.
Enable when a project targets Neo4j:

- **`gen-neo4j-constraints`** emits Cypher DDL (uniqueness, existence, property-type constraints, and
  `CREATE INDEX` for any slot annotated `annotations: {neo4j_index: true}`). Targets **Neo4j Community
  Edition only** — `--profile community` (uniqueness + indexes, the subset this generator can
  currently prove runs on Community) vs `--profile full` (also existence/type, carried over from an
  assumption not yet re-verified against a real Community instance; see the generator's own module
  docstring for the current state of that verification). It emits no relationship-level constraints
  and no application-layer validation (patterns, enum membership, numeric bounds, relationship
  cardinality) — that's `gen-neomodel`'s job, on the Python side, not a second Cypher-side mechanism.
- **`gen-neomodel`** emits neomodel `StructuredNode` classes, mirroring the schema's `is_a` hierarchy as
  real Python inheritance (abstract LinkML classes become `__abstract_node__ = True` bases) so that a
  relationship whose range is an abstract class resolves correctly instead of pointing at an undefined
  name. A slot's `any_of` range restriction is documented as a trailing comment on the generated
  relationship, not mechanically enforced. Also note: neomodel reserves the Python attribute names
  `id`, `deleted`, `element_id` — a schema whose identifier slot is (conventionally) named `id` gets a
  `_`-suffixed Python attribute (`id_`) with `db_property=...` preserving the real Neo4j property key.

#### Installing

Pick your role:

| You are… | Do this |
|---|---|
| **Scaffolding a new project** with `project-setup` | Answer LinkML (Q4.5) + Neo4j (Q5.1) in the interview, or pass `--neo4j` directly to `scaffold.sh` (product archetype only). This copies both generators into your repo's `scripts/`, pinned. |
| **Adding it to an existing project** | Re-run `project-setup` (`scaffold.sh ... --neo4j --skip-existing`) — additive, never touches unrelated files. |
| **Working inside skillery itself** | No install needed — run them directly from `tools/linkml_neo4j/`. |

The pinned copy in your repo is a **snapshot**, not a live link back to skillery — refresh it by
re-running `project-setup` with `--force` (shows what changed; never silently overwritten), same
discipline as the `meaningfy` OpenSpec schema pin (`spine-projection.md`).

#### Using

```bash
# From your project root, once scripts/gen_neo4j_constraints.py + gen_neomodel.py exist:
pip install linkml click jinja2 neomodel   # generator dependencies (not runtime deps of your project)

python scripts/gen_neo4j_constraints.py model/schema.yaml --profile community > model/generated/neo4j/constraints.cypher
python scripts/gen_neomodel.py model/schema.yaml > model/generated/neomodel/ogm.py
```

Wire both into your project's `make generate-models` (or an equivalent `make neo4j-constraints` /
`make neomodel` target) the same way `gen-pydantic`/`gen-owl`/`gen-shacl` already are — see "The
`make generate-models` bridge" above. `--profile` defaults to `full`; pass `community` explicitly if
you're deploying to Neo4j Community and want only the constraint types this generator can currently
prove run there (see its module docstring for the current verification state).

Both generators ship with a synthetic fixture schema and a vendored real-world fixture as their test
suite (`tests/test_linkml_neo4j_generators.py`); `project-setup` projects a pinned copy into a
consuming repo, refreshed the same way as the `meaningfy` OpenSpec schema (re-run, review the diff,
never silently overwritten).

## Architectural boundary for generated modules

Generated models still live inside the layered architecture (see `cosmic-python`): `models` (generated or
not) must not import `services`/`adapters`/`entrypoints`. If parallel versioned/variant model packages
exist (v1/v2/v3, per tenant), enforce their independence with `import-linter` the same as hand-written
code — codegen is not an exemption from the architecture.
