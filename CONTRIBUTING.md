## Submission Process

### Step 1: Create Your Skill

Follow the [Creating Skills Guide](spec/CREATING_SKILLS.md) to develop your skill.

### Step 2: Update the Skill Inventory

Add your skill to the **What's inside** table in README.md (columns: Bundle, Skill, Purpose):

```markdown
| `meaningfy-building` | **my-new-skill** | Short purpose |
```

### Step 3: Register in Marketplace

Add your skill path (flat: `./skills/<skill>`) to the appropriate **role bundle**
in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`. The four bundles are `meaningfy-core`,
`meaningfy-consulting`, `meaningfy-architecture`, and `meaningfy-building` — every
skill belongs to exactly one. The validator (`make validate`) enforces that each
skill sits in its expected bundle (`EXPECTED_BUNDLES` in `tools/repo_lint/lint.py`
— update it when adding a skill):

```json
{ "name": "meaningfy-building", "skills": ["./skills/clarity-gate", "./skills/my-new-skill"] }
```

### Step 4: Create a Pull Request

1. **Commit your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add skills/my-new-skill
   git add .claude-plugin/marketplace.json
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Add my-new-skill"
   ```

2. **Push to your branch:**
   ```bash
   git push origin skills/my-new-skill
   ```

3. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub with:
   - Clear title: "Add [skill-name]"
   - Description of what the skill does
   - Reference any related issues
   - Confirmation that checklist items are complete

## Skill Guidelines

### Scope: What Makes a Good Skill?

✅ **Good skill:**
- Focuses on a specific domain or use case
- Provides value for Claude users
- Is well-documented with examples
- Is discoverable by clear description
- Has clear limitations documented

❌ **Not a good fit:**
- Too broad/general (e.g., "helper skill")
- Poorly defined scope or description
- Minimal documentation
- Duplicate of existing skill
- Requires undocumented external dependencies

### Naming Convention

Use lowercase with hyphens:
- ✅ `data-analyzer`, `json-transformer`, `ml-workflow`
- ❌ `DataAnalyzer`, `json_transformer`, `ml-workflow-v2`

### Description Quality

Your description is the primary discovery mechanism. Make it clear:

✅ **Good:**
```
description: Transform and validate JSON data. Use for parsing files,
converting formats, validating against schemas, or generating reports.
```

❌ **Poor:**
```
description: JSON skill for data
```

### Progressive Disclosure

Keep SKILL.md concise by organizing documentation:

```
SKILL.md (quick-start, core concepts)
  ↓
references/REFERENCE.md (complete API)
references/EXAMPLES.md (use cases)
references/ADVANCED.md (complex patterns)
```

## PR Review Process

When you submit a pull request:

1. **Automated Checks:** GitHub Actions will verify:
   - YAML frontmatter validity
   - Required files present
   - Directory naming conventions
   - File size limits

2. **Code Review:** Maintainers will check:
   - Skill quality and documentation
   - Alignment with guidelines
   - No conflicts with existing skills
   - License compliance

3. **Testing:** We may test:
   - Skill discoverability
   - SKILL.md formatting
   - Script functionality

4. **Merge:** Once approved, your skill is merged and becomes available to all users!

## Updating Existing Skills

To update an existing skill:

1. **Make changes** to the skill files
2. **Test thoroughly** to ensure no regressions
3. **Update version** in YAML metadata if making breaking changes
4. **Document changes** in your PR description
5. **Submit PR** with clear description of what changed

## Removing Skills

To remove or deprecate a skill:

1. **Notify users** in the PR description
2. **Remove from marketplace.json**
3. **Keep skill directory** (for history) but mark as deprecated
4. **Add notice** to SKILL.md if keeping it:
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: old-skill
   description: DEPRECATED - Use new-skill instead
   ---
   ```
