## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: writing-antipatterns owns the register/genre-conditional antipattern catalogue

The catalogue SHALL provide a `writing-antipatterns` skill in `meaningfy-core` that owns a
cross-cutting genre map (8 genres, each naming its owning skill and register signature), a short
list of unguarded defects that apply regardless of genre, and a canonical inversion matrix of
genre-conditional antipatterns (each entry stating where it fails, where the same move is
required, the guard question, the detection cue, and the fix). It SHALL NOT own the voice profile
(`company-voice.md`), the Diátaxis quadrant definitions (`explanatory-writing`'s fit-map), model or
diagram-structure antipatterns (`modelling-conventions`, `architecture`), or a genre for any domain
(sales, PM, BI) that already maps onto one of the 8 named genres.

#### Scenario: A genre is looked up for a drafting task

- **WHEN** a skill is producing prose in one of the 8 named genres
- **THEN** it links to that genre's reference file in `writing-antipatterns` rather than
  restating antipattern guidance inline

#### Scenario: A domain is mistaken for a genre

- **WHEN** a contributor considers adding a new genre for a domain (e.g. "sales", "PM", "BI")
- **THEN** the genre map's existing 8 genres are checked first; the domain artefact is classified
  as a flavour of an existing genre unless no current skill could plausibly own it

#### Scenario: A model-structure antipattern is proposed for inclusion

- **WHEN** a proposed addition concerns model or diagram structure rather than prose/rhetoric
  (e.g. "god-class", "free strings where a controlled set belongs")
- **THEN** it is rejected from this skill and pointed at `modelling-conventions` or `architecture`,
  whichever already owns it

### Requirement: Antipattern entries are single-sourced; per-genre files are filtered views

Each antipattern SHALL have exactly one canonical prose entry in
`references/inversion-matrix.md`. Per-genre reference files SHALL contain only a pointer table
(move, status, link to the canonical entry) and SHALL NOT restate an entry's smell, fix, or
detection cue text.

#### Scenario: A new antipattern is added

- **WHEN** a new genre-conditional antipattern is documented
- **THEN** it is added as one row in `inversion-matrix.md`, and each affected per-genre file gains
  one pointer-table row linking back to it — no antipattern text is duplicated across files

#### Scenario: A per-genre file is audited

- **WHEN** a per-genre reference file is reviewed
- **THEN** every row is a pointer (move name, status, link) and no full smell/fix/cue prose
  appears outside `inversion-matrix.md`

### Requirement: Unguarded and guarded defects are kept distinct

The skill SHALL separate defects that hold in every genre (unguarded, stated once in `SKILL.md`)
from defects whose correctness depends on genre (guarded, stated in `inversion-matrix.md` with an
explicit guard question). Hedging (guarded) and weasel words / unattributed authority (unguarded)
SHALL be documented as distinct entries.

#### Scenario: Hedging is confused with weasel words

- **WHEN** a claim uses an epistemic qualifier on the author's own statement
- **THEN** it is classified under the guarded Hedging entry, not the unguarded weasel-words entry

#### Scenario: A claim is attributed to an unnamed source

- **WHEN** a claim reads "studies show" or "some experts believe" with no named source
- **THEN** it is classified under the unguarded weasel-words entry regardless of genre

### Requirement: Every writing-family skill cross-references without restating

`technical-writing`, `explanatory-writing`, `executive-communication`, `proposal-writing`,
`decision-package`, `architecture`, and `semantic-consulting-coach` SHALL each carry one
`Related:` reference to `writing-antipatterns` and SHALL NOT copy any antipattern content inline.

#### Scenario: A writing-family skill's boundary section is audited

- **WHEN** the reference audit checks a writing-family skill's `Related:` section
- **THEN** `writing-antipatterns` is listed, and no antipattern smell/fix/cue text is duplicated in
  that skill's own body
